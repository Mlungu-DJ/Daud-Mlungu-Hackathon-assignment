                            <dd> Highly profiency in this programming language.</dd>
                        </tr>
                    </P>
                </li>

                            <dd> this is the third language skilled about but am averaged with it where i know only about basics but am progressing with it since it seems like python being slightly differ is some codes such as its's code start with "Var" and ends with semicolon(;) while in python not.</dd>
                        </tr>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="own">Land use and land cover changes detection</li>
                            <p>This project this project was done using the google Earth engine and a Semi-automatic classification plugn in QGIS and was concerned in detection of land use and land cover changes at Morogoro urban, Dodoma urban and Arusha urban, so as to detect the urban foerst ecosystem changes and how it affects the urban biodiversity, hence comming up with the land use planning that take into consideration of an urban biodiversity</p>
                        <li class="own">Forest changes detection project</li>
                            <p>This is conducted using the google earth engine to detect the temporal changes of the fores cover at the eastern arc Uluguru mountain so as to identify the rate of change and the drivers for that change</p>
                        <li class="own">Protected area mapping</li>
                            <P>This project was conducted using the shape files and some digitizations in QGIS in order to detect the boundaries of a protected areas so as to understand the aniaml ranging and ensure easy Management.</P>
